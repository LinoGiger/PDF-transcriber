I'm here to help with your translation needs. If you have a Russian text or a PDF file that you'd like translated into English, please provide it, and I'll get started on the translation for you. If it's a PDF, please upload the file, and I'll extract and translate the text for you. If the document is lengthy, I'll let you know how far I've translated and ask for the remaining pages.
