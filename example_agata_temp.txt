JULY STRATEGY  
In July, we adhere to a strategy focused on warming up the audience and sales. This strategy is called "I am the product of my product."  
In social networks, the principle of craftsmanship works – this means that people are most willing to buy goods, seek services, and strive for knowledge from those people whose products they see changing their lives. A sale happens when a person sees in your life what they themselves aspire to. Therefore, it is important to show that your product, service, or training will bring you what the client wants, and you are the product of your product. We often share some impressions. For example, how nice it is that you get so much attention from men. Or some benefit. For example, how to correctly collect feedback from clients in a beauty studio so that they leave it in large quantities. But people do not draw a parallel between information and our product. They do not realize that your skill in applying makeup and maintaining your appearance is related to increased attention from the opposite sex. Or that your ability to work with feedback forms a strong client base. Therefore, we need to explain the connection between our result and the product ourselves – so that the person understands that they can achieve the same result, that with the help of what we have, and what they can also use, they will get what they strive for. For example, there is an entrepreneur who conducted research among the target audience, identified requests on how people want to package their goods in offline business, assembled a team for this, developed a product, and offered very favorable conditions. For example, payment after production, discounts on circulation, and so on. There is also another person who developed a cool package in their offline business, and everyone started asking what kind of package it was and where to make it. He started offering it to everyone, but did not come up with it himself. Everyone wanted to repeat it, but did not know how – lacked tools and ideas. So the person formed a natural demand. Then, based on this demand, he created a service, he will develop packaging for other goods that you had, and launched this business, constantly talking about the results that the packaging gave him in his own business. Who do you think buyers are most likely to turn to? Of course, to the person who not only showed how to apply it, sees difficulties, solves them, because he went through it himself, and he himself is the product of his product. And this is very important because a person trusts a person 20 times more than a product.  
Your task is to choose 2-3 definitions that describe your feature, uniqueness, or distinction. In my case, it is simplicity and psychology, because I show how to make working content very simply, using psychological knowledge and how to influence a person. You also need to highlight 2-3 words that describe you, and then all the benefits you will provide should be in these themes. If you have a product business, you just need to divide all the useful content. For example, your distinction is communication on a first-name basis. The second theme can be accompanying – femininity. In this case, you can make useful content on two topics: on one hand, talk about fabrics, and on the other – raise the topic of femininity and its manifestations.
