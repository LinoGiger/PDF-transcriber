**COOKBOOK**

---

**My favorite dish, which my mother used to make for me, was a fluffy omelet with sausages. That's where it all began. How does it become so fluffy, why, what ingredients are included, why does it have such an unforgettable aroma and unique taste?**

**When her friends came to visit us, they would step aside, amazed at how I cooked in the kitchen, with what enjoyment I did it and how it turned out. Such attentiveness to every little detail. My mother understood immediately and guided me. I loved being around in the kitchen, observing what she did and trying to change something myself.**

**All roads led me to culinary arts.**

**Now I understand that I inherited my calling from my grandmother, who cooked with so much joy and passion. She conveyed her love for cooking to me through the tactile movements of her hands. Her memory still resides in my hands, and something in you, some memories or habits, belong to her. When your soul moves through your body, it is partly her memory, and a large part of her became intertwined with my time spent in the kitchen.**

**The history of PARAR began once when the dishes lifted from winter Kotharia. Three years, and three years of experience in the restaurant business with a variety of kitchens, have allowed you to see today's perspective in the menu. In the summer sweets of the season. In Italy, where you flourished along with us, our scenes, where you, along with us, discover new tastes, emotions, bursting with emotion, and I am a piece of sunny Italy.**
